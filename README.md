## Introduction
This is a code repository for my 3D developer portfolio website. I built this portfolio to replace my previous minimal portfolio and complement my GitHub profile and terminal website. This custom website showcases my skills through Three.js 3D graphics, interactive animations, and parallax effects while maintaining an intuitive and user-friendly design.

The website provides potential clients and employers with a quick insight into my capabilities, not only through the listed projects but also through the development of the website itself.

## Technologies Used
- **Vite** - Build tool for efficient development
- **JavaScript** - Core programming language
- **React** - Frontend JavaScript library for building dynamic UIs
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Three.js** - JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics
- **Framer Motion** - Library for animations and interactive motion effects
- **Hostinger** - Web hosting platform
